Fine-Tuning with Efficiency: LoRA and QLoRA for Large Language Models
Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP), offering remarkable capabilities. However, their immense size presents significant challenges for adaptation. Fine-tuning, the process of tailoring a pre-trained model to specific tasks or domains, becomes computationally expensive. Enter Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Quantized LoRA (QLoRA), parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques that significantly reduce the resources needed for adaptation.

Understanding Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques aim to optimize and adapt large models with minimal computational overhead. Instead of updating all parameters of the model, PEFT methods adjust a small subset or introduce additional parameters that can be trained efficiently. This approach preserves the majority of the pre-trained modelâ€™s knowledge while focusing computational resources on the necessary adaptations.
